This is the README for your project. If you choose to publish an open source `app`
for this project, this is what will be displayed on [Autocode Apps](/app).
**The first line** will be used as the title of the app. Otherwise, you should use it
to record important information about the project for yourself or your teammates.

## Preview
This Project is ran through a production bot in order to use the actual bot. It is linked through API Discord which lets you use your own code and import them through API such as an webhook.

## Purpose
This bot is used for slash commands and basic commands to perform the codes that have been implanted within this bot.
Most commands are custom, so if you were to copy the code it will not work due to having to manually create your own slash commands and implant the code yourself.
This bot is multi-purpose
